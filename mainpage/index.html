            <h2>Striving For Physical & Virtual Excellence</h2>For years, I have been looking for my true calling. 
            I have tried many things, but nothing has come close to the joy I feel when I set myself under a dangerously heavy loaded barbell.<br>
            I find balance in my life between my computer-based studies and clanking weights, when I push myself to the limit in every field I possibly can.<br>
            I live a hardcore lifestyle. I give my all to everything I do, no excuses. <br>

            <h2>About me</h2>I was born in 1997 in Mikkeli, Finland. I was dropped on my head a bunch of times as a baby, which explains a lot.<br>
            My head is strong and my body is even stronger. I have a large head, but that just means I have a lot of room for my brain to grow.<br>
            I have lived in Helsinki for the majority of my life. My roots are in Turkey, but I am a true Finn at heart.<br>
            I consider myself a bodybuilder nowadays, since I push myself harder than ever before. My goal is to gather as much mass as naturally possible.
