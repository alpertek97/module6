            <p>Bodybuilding is a sport, which requires sacrifice. It is not an easy journey toward greatness. To truly maximize your potential, you must dedicate years of your life to hard work.</p>
            <p>Hard work in this context means excersizing 3-5 times per week, eating well-balanced meals, good sleeping & resting, educating yourself through books/internet and most crucial of all; studying and experimenting your SELF. </p>

I hate that."</p><br><p>"The resistance that you fight physically in the gym and the resistance that you fight in life can only build a strong character."</p><br><p>"The last three or four reps is what makes the muscle grow. This area of pain divides a champion from someone who is not a champion."</p><br><p>"Strength does not come from winning. Your struggles develop your strengths. When you go through hardships and decide not to surrender, that is strength."</p>
